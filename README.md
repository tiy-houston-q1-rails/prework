The Iron Yard: Rails Engineering Prework
=============

### What is Prework?

Prework is a series of base information designed to bring you up to speed before
the class.  There is a series of Books (for reference), Courses, Tools, and
Advanced materials.

### Why does Prework Help?

Ideally, when class begins, you'll hear the concepts for a second time. The plan
is, the 2nd time you learn it, it sticks. And by the third time you learn it,
you're able to teach it.

Starting learning before the class is like *training for a marathon*. You don't
show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our
classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. _This prework is training
for your brain_.

### What won't the PreWork do for you

Prework only covers the basics of a language; What we teach goes much deeper
than tutorials can cover.

We create "T" based developers -- people with both Breadth of knowledge, as well
as depth of knowledge.

The knowledge for all of our technologies is out there, available to all. We
love this, embrace it, and encourage you to learn both inside and outside the
class.
