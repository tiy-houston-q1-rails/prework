Eloquent Ruby
=============

Eloquent Ruby is the first book I have people read; it shows Ruby as a language
that reads like prose. English is the heart of ruby: methods read like english.

Example:

~~~ruby
class Human
  include Hungry
  has_many :pizzas
end
~~~

Without knowing anything about Ruby, or Rails, you can deduce what the code is
trying to say. (_Or at least, you can tell the human is hungry and is about to
eat some major pizzas_)

you can read the book for free at
[SafariOnline](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/web-development/ruby/9780321700308). You'll create a trial account to do so.

> Michael Fogus says that Eloquent Ruby is “﻿the perfect book to highlight
> this masterful language and Russ’s blend of wit and wisdom is certain to
> entertain and inform.”

> Peter Cooper thinks that Eloquent Ruby Rocks! He also says that “I
> wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone except those who, well, could
> have written a similar book themselves. The short punchy chapters make it a
> delight to read and gives the option of reading it merely 10 minutes at a time
> before bed or similar. The short chapters also make it useful as a reference
> if you forget how to do a certain thing like, say, use method_missing, even
> though it’s not put together as a reference book at all. Lastly, this book is
> a must read if you’re not confident with Ruby idioms and the best way to
> structure and lay out your code – Russ’s approaches reinforce the current
> “standard” way to write Ruby and this alone is worth the price of admission.”
