Codeschool (Setup)
===================

codeschool is run by the EnvyLabs folks in Orlando. It consists of high quality
videos, with interactive challenges.

It normally costs $29 a month, but I've paid for your pre-work month. Once
the IronYard course starts, it's up to you to decide for yourself if you want to
pay.

Once you are accepted and have paid your deposit, you'll get an email invite to
codeschool. You can use that to login and complete courses.

I'll be able to see your progress during the course.
